The governing equation you provided is more of an algebraic formula rather than a PDE. To incorporate spatial effects, we'll assume a 2D heat conduction equation across the panel.\n\n2. Since this is a solar panel model, we'll need to generate a 2D mesh of the panel surface.\n\n3. We'll need to create sample input data for irradiance and material properties.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with these assumptions?",
