To make it more realistic, we'll need to:\n   - Add temperature dependence to the efficiency\n   - Consider the entire PV system with proper physics\n   - Include time-dependent effects\n\n2. For the governing equations, we should use something more comprehensive than P=\u03b7AG. A better approach would be to model the PV electrical output coupled with thermal effects.\n\n3. The assumptions need to be expanded to include things like temperature effects on efficiency, panel orientation, and heat loss mechanisms.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with developing a more comprehensive solar PV model that includes these aspects?",
