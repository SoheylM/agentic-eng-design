  # MyPy — advisory only; run `mypy .` manually to see type errors.
  # Kept out of the default pre-commit pipeline because the codebase
  # relies on conditional imports in llm_models.py that mypy cannot
  # resolve without a running LLM backend.  Re-enable once stubs or
  # a TYPE_CHECKING guard are added.
